# About Me

Hello, my name is Kurt Neiswender. I am an architect living and working in Flint, Michigan. However, I am not an original Michigander, yes that is what we call ourselves in this state!&#x20;

I was born in Stamford, Connecticut and was raised there until I went off to college when I was eighteen.&#x20;

I attended the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, California. This experience was where my interest in architecture grew into a passion and this passion was fueled by the work of deconstructivist avant-garde architects like Morphosis, Eric Owen Moss, and others. I am sure I will share more names and inspirational projects throughout this garden.&#x20;

After receiving my degree from USC I worked in various firms around Los Angeles, cutting my teeth on offices of all sizes.&#x20;
