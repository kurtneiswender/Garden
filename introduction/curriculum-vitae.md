## SELECTED PROJECTS

**2019‚ÄîPresent ‚ÄúThe Coffee Sketch Podcast‚Äù 100+ Episodes**

**www.coffeesketchpodcast.com**

Co-founded a weekly podcast with friend and architect Jamie Crawley, AIA, inspired by Jamie and Kurt‚Äôs shared passion for sketching, coffee and conversation. Coffee Sketch Podcast is our take on the intersection of old tech and new tech the space between the traditional practice of the hand-drawn sketch that has been performed by architects and designers for centuries and the modern day use of the #hashtag as a representation of sentiment or a movement! Each week we plan to deliver a new pod about our ideas, sketches, and what‚Äôs going in our daily lives as we pursue our love of architecture, design, and sharing this knowledge with the next generation.

**2017-2018‚ÄîUniversity of Michigan EDA Center Provost Grant**

**$40,000.00 Grant Exploring Pop Up Retail**

The intent of this project is to explore emergent trends in ‚Äúpop-up‚Äù style retail and concepts in innovative business incubation. This proposal outlines the exploration through community survey and participatory design charrettes. I plan to engage with two to three community partners representing downtown, suburban, and rural environments sampled from the seven EDA counties. The fundamental goals of this project is to identify appropriate sites that have socioeconomic and environmental conditions that can sustain pop-up retail kiosks, and create opportunities for citizens to access incremental business storefronts that are not feasible with traditional ‚Äúbricks and mortar‚Äù lease space.

**2016‚ÄîDewey Park and Foss Avenue Neighborhood Pavilions**

**Design/Build with Habitat for Humanity**

I provided pro-bono services partnered with the Genesee County Habitat for Humanity in a Citywide Request for Proposal for two pavilions on public land in Flint. Through the collaboration with Genesee County Habitat for Humanity, my design was chosen as the winning proposal and awarded the contract for both pavilions. The construction budget for both pavilions is $50,000.00 including design services, permits, materials and labor. Both pavilions are scheduled to be complete by June of 2016.

**2014-Present‚ÄîPassive House Projects**

**Using Advanced Framing and Energy Modeling to Improve the Built Environment**

Kurt managed the design and construction of Michigan‚Äôs first two United States Passive House Institute (PHIUS) Passive Homes. Passive House is the most energy efficient construction rating for residential buildings by reducing energy consumption up to 80%-90% better than standard construction. The result is minimal dependence on fossil fuels and increased health benefits from lower emissions. Currently working on three new net zero energy projects in Michigan.
