# ðŸ‘¨ðŸ’¼ About Me

## Who am I?

Hello, my name is Kurt Neiswender. I am an architect living and working in Flint, Michigan. However, I am not an original [Michigander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigander), yes that is what we call ourselves in this state!&#x20;

## Where am I From?

I was born in Stamford, Connecticut and was raised there until I went off to college when I was eighteen.&#x20;

## Schooling

I attended the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, California. This experience was where my interest in architecture grew into a passion and this passion was fueled by the work of [deconstructivist ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deconstructivism)avant-garde architects like [Morphosis](https://www.morphosis.com/), [Eric Owen Moss](http://ericowenmoss.com/), and others. I am sure I will share more names and inspirational projects throughout this garden.&#x20;

After receiving my degree from USC I worked in various firms around Los Angeles, cutting my teeth on offices of all sizes.&#x20;

## More Info

For those who are curious I will paste a current version of my [Curriculum Vitae](curriculum-vitae.md) so you can see the diversity of my experience and how I got here.&#x20;
