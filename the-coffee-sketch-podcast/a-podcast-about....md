# ðŸŽ™ A Podcast About...

Some of you know that I host a podcast called [Coffee Sketch Podcast](https://www.coffeesketchpodcast.com/) with my good friend, Jamie Crawley, AIA. He and I have been doing this since 2018. We started with the idea to have an excuse really to stay in touch with each other after our AIA committee work ended. This brainfart turned into a mutual passion to share our thoughts and knowledge around architecture through the medium of the sketch. We often talk about coffee, football (soccer), and current events, and invite other friends who share a passion for drawing.&#x20;

If you care to listen, our first episode is below, and you can subscribe through any of the regular podcast services.&#x20;

> Coffee Sketch Podcast is our take on the intersection of old tech and new tech. The space between the traditional practice of the hand-drawn sketch that has been performed by architects and designers for centuries AND the modern day use of the #hashtag as a representation of sentiment or a movement! Each week will plan to deliver a new pod about our ideas, sketches, and whatâ€™s going in our daily lives as we pursue our love of architecture, design, and sharing this knowledge with the next generation.&#x20;
