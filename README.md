# ☀ Introduction

If you are not aware of the concept of a Digital Garden, I will expand on that as this space grows. In a nutshell, I look forward to sharing my experiences, thoughts, and interests in and around the profession of architecture.&#x20;

I feel awakened by the potential of what a Digital Garden can do to help me spread knowledge and use what is called Public Learning to sow the seeds that others will germinate and ultimately create fruit for future architects that then can sow new seeds and continue the process.&#x20;

If you want me to expand on any of the subjects in this Digital Garden feel free to connect with me on [Twitter @kurtneiswender ](https://twitter.com/kurtneiswender)or visit my business website to see more of my project work at [urbancolab.design](https://urbancolab.design).&#x20;
